For this activity update, most of the requirements have been fulfilled. I create a ViewModel to hold the task/todo data. 
And deploy a Room database, connect the database with ViewModel.
For now, this app can store any new task or edit an existing task, and save the changes into the local database.

One additional thing that I implement is the right swipe to delete a task.
