The main purpose of this lesson is to learn how to implement multiple `Activity` and `Intent`, so that we can send data from one activity to another:

- An  `Activity`  is an app component that provides a single screen focused on a single user task, each `Activity` has its own user interface layout file..
- We can assign `Activity` a parent/child relationship.
- An `Intent` lets you request an action from another component in your app.

### Homework: (optional, will finish in future)
- **Build and run an app**

- **Question 1**: What changes are made when you add a second `Activity` to your app by choosing **File > New > Activity** and an `Activity` template? Choose one:

- **Question 2**: What happens if you remove the `android:parentActivityName` and the `<meta-data>` elements from the second `Activity` declaration in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file? Choose one:

- **Question 3**: Which constructor method do you use to create a new explicit `Intent`? Choose one:

- **Question 4**: In the HelloToast app homework, how do you add the current value of the count to the `Intent`? Choose one:

- **Question 5**: In the HelloToast app homework, how do you display the current count in the second "Hello" `Activity`? Choose one:
