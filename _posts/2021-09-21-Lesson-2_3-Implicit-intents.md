The main purpose of this lesson is to learn the Implicit intents.

- An implicit  `Intent`  allows you to activate an  `Activity`  if you know the action, but not the specific app or  `Activity`  that will handle that action.
- The Android system matches the content of an implicit  `Intent`  and the  `Intent`  filters of any available  `Activity`  to determine which  `Activity`  to activate. If there is more than one available  `Activity`, the system provides a chooser so the user can pick one.
### Homework: (optional, will finish in future)
- **Build and run an app**

- **Question 1**: Which constructor method do you use to create an implicit `Intent` to launch a camera app?
	
- **Question 2**: When you create an implicit `Intent` object, which of the following is true?
	
- **Question 3**: Which `Intent` action do you use to take a picture with a camera app?
