After the Todo App check-in meeting, I decided to spend some extra time researching how to improve my Todo App.

The following are some brief thoughts, which will be supplemented with the information I found and feasibility analysis in the follow-up.

- Material Design UX
- Implement search to-dos
- Delete confirmation or cancellation
- Redesign the user interface
- Deploy a cloud database to store data
